                                            Roommate Compatibility Connection
In the Roommate Compatibility Connection project, we leveraged Microsoft Azure for robust cloud infrastructure, ensuring scalability and reliability. Utilizing Azure's services, we efficiently managed and processed the extensive data required for roommate matching algorithms. The project also featured a user-friendly frontend, allowing individuals to easily assess their compatibility with potential roommates. Through an intuitive interface, users could input preferences and receive personalized compatibility scores, streamlining the roommate selection process. This comprehensive solution not only facilitated efficient data handling in the cloud but also enhanced the user experience for individuals seeking compatible living arrangements.
